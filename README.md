## Description 🧐
This Terraform project aims to automate the setup and management of two environments, dev and prod, across two AWS regions: us-east-1 and eu-central-1. It also integrates Jenkins for continuous deployment and also includes automation for updating a Terraform state file stored in an S3 bucket and triggering a Lambda function to send email notifications using AWS SES if any changes happen in the state files.

## Technologies Used

We've utilized a wide range of technologies to develop this project, including:

*    terraform
*    aws s3
*    aws lambda
*    aws ses
*    aws dynamodb
*   Docker
*   jenkins
*    python
## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* Terraform installed on your Jenkins server.
* AWS CLI configured with necessary credentials and permissions.
* S3 bucket for storing Terraform state files.
* dynamodb talbe configured for state lock
* AWS lambda configured for using ses service.
* AWS SES configured for sending email notifications (if applicable).
* Jenkins server with necessary plugins (if applicable).

## Usage 🚀
### cloning the Project

1. Clone this repository to your Jenkins server or local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdalla-abdelsalam/InfraControl
```

```bash
cd  InfraControl
```
### Terraform Backend Initializing
You can use the below script to create the necessary terraform backend (s3 bucket for storing the state and dynamodb table for state locking)

### Initialize Terraform in the project directory

```bash
terraform init
```

## Creating Workspaces

This project includes two predefined workspaces: dev and prod. 
You can create them using the following commands:

For dev workspace:
```bash
terraform workspace new dev
```
For prod workspace:

```bash
terraform workspace new prod
```


## Managing Variables

Customize the variable values in the dev.tfvars and prod.tfvars files to match your specific environment requirements.

Select the appropriate workspace for the environment you want to create:

```bash
terraform workspace select dev
```
OR
```bash
terraform workspace select prod
```

Apply the Terraform configuration to create the infrastructure:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
```
OR
```bash
terraform apply -var-file=prod.tfvars
```

## Executing Local Provisioner

After creating the infrastructure, the local-exec provisioner will print the public IP of the Bastion EC2 instance in the specified environment. This is automatically done as part of the Terraform apply process.

## Jenkins Integration

This project integrates Jenkins for continuous deployment. The Jenkins pipeline configured to accept an env-param, which determines which Terraform environment to apply changes to (dev or prod), also there is an optional param if you want to destroy the infrastructure
### jenkins server deployment using docker 

You can use this dockerfile for building docker image that includes jenkins server and terrform will be also installed

### Jenkinsfile & stages
#### before pipeline stages
you should add aws credentials that includes:
* aws_access_key
* aws_secrets_access_key
  
to jenkins server as secrets file or text
![Screenshot from 2023-10-02 16-39-45](https://github.com/abdalla-abdelsalam/InfraControl/assets/51873396/9bbc3068-3e8e-4ef8-9b57-d1a1ff798c91)

we will reference these secrests in the jenkinsfile and expose them as environment variables to make terraform able to access aws.

in the image below we also configure 2 parameters to pass to jenkins pipeline before executing :
* environment (dev or prod)
* boolean for the destroying option

#### stage one
Intializing terraform and selecting the desired workspace, 
also create the workspace if not exsits.

#### stage two 
Terraform apply stage with passing the necessary evn variable file and also archieving the inventory file that contains the public ip of the bastian host

#### stage three
This stage is responsible for printing the public ip address of the bastian host

#### stage four
This is the destroy stage (only executed if the destroy option is set to true)

The ip matches the one from the aws console

## Email Notifications with AWS SES
Before using an email address in your Lambda function to send email notifications, it must be verified in AWS SES (Simple Email Service). Follow the verification steps in the AWS SES console to ensure the email address is authorized to send emails.

## lambda function
This project includes a Lambda function that sends email notifications using AWS SES when the Terraform state in the S3 bucket is updated.

Also don't forget to give the lambda the necessary permissions to access ses service.

## Event notifiction in s3 bucket
Configure an S3 event notification that watches for changes to the Terraform state file in your S3 bucket. When the state file is updated, this event will automatically invoke a Lambda function, enabling real-time responses to state changes and allowing for actions like sending notifications .

## Getting an email notifiction 
when an update happens to terraform state file in s3 bucket an email notificdtion sent to indicate that a change in the state happened
